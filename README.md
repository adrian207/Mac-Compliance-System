## Component Structure

**Core Services**
- `core/` - Configuration, logging, and shared utilities
- `telemetry/` - Device data collection and aggregation
- `risk_engine/` - Risk scoring and assessment logic
- `workflows/` - Automated security response orchestration
- `integrations/` - Security tool API connectors

**Security Modules**
- `hardening/` - Mac OS baseline configurations and policies
- `enforcement/` - Policy deployment and validation
- `monitoring/` - Analytics, alerting, and dashboards

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Mac OS endpoints with administrative access
- API credentials for integrated security tools
- PostgreSQL or compatible database

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Mac-Hardening

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp config/config.example.yaml config/config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your credentials and settings

# Initialize database and run migrations
python scripts/init_database.py
python scripts/migrate.py upgrade

# Run initial setup
python scripts/setup.py
```

### Configuration

Edit `config/config.yaml` to configure:
- Security tool API credentials (Kandji, Zscaler, Seraphic)
- Risk scoring thresholds and policies
- Workflow automation rules
- Alert and notification settings
- Database connection parameters

### Running the Platform

```bash
# Start the main service
python main.py

# Run in background with logging
nohup python main.py > logs/platform.log 2>&1 &

# Use Docker (recommended for production)
docker-compose up -d
```

## Risk Scoring Methodology

The platform calculates device risk scores (0-100) based on:

**Security Posture Factors (40%)**
- OS version and patch level
- Security tool installation and health
- Firewall and encryption status
- Authentication configuration

**Compliance Factors (30%)**
- Policy adherence
- Configuration drift
- Required software presence
- Certificate validity

**Behavioral Factors (20%)**
- Access patterns and anomalies
- Network connections
- Login attempts and failures
- File system changes

**Threat Indicators (10%)**
- Malware detections
- Suspicious processes
- Network threats
- Vulnerability exposure

## Automated Workflow Examples

### High Risk Device Response
```yaml
trigger: device_risk_score > 75
actions:
  - Reset network access tokens (Zscaler)
  - Force MFA re-authentication
  - Isolate device to quarantine network
  - Alert security operations team
  - Create incident ticket
```

### Non-Compliant Device Remediation
```yaml
trigger: compliance_violations > 3
actions:
  - Deploy corrective policies (Kandji)
  - Restrict network access
  - Send user notification
  - Schedule compliance review
  - Escalate if unresolved after 24h
```

### Zero Trust Access Enforcement
